        <h2>Hey, thanks for stopping by.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm Taine from West Auckland, and over the last 8ish years, I've
          explored a variety of interests. From songwriting and music production
          to dabbling in the YouTube space, where I even had the chance to open
          for one of my favourite musicians. After school, I went all in on an
          IT and Security Systems diploma, landing a support role at ESET
          Security.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Driven by my creative side, I then decided to pursue a Bachelor's in
          Communications with a focus on Advertising, spending three years
          creating social content for brands like McDonald's, Woolworths, Sky,
          and Frucor. However, I realised advertising didn’t fully fulfil me,
          and I wanted a new challenge. That led me to Dev Academy, after
          hearing friends’ experiences learning to code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Persistence is key for me. When solutions aren’t clear, I stay
          patient, try new approaches, and keep pushing forward. I have a few
          close friends who have been working in web development for some time,
          and their passion has rubbed off on me I guess! I'm excited to be here
          and look forward to meeting you all in person.
