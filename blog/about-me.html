      <h2>Hey, thanks for stopping by.</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm Taine from West Auckland, and I've explored various paths. I spent a
        few years in music, focusing on songwriting and production. I also tried
        YouTube and had the chance to open for one of my favorite musicians.
        After earning a diploma in IT and Security Systems from Ames, I worked
        support for ESET Security. Needing to flex my creative bones, I decided
        I wanted to be an art director so I got my bachelor's degree in
        Communications majoring in Advertising. I spent three years whipping up
        social content for various clients such as Maccas, Woolworths, Sky, and
        Frucor brands.

        Eventually I realised that advertising didnâ€™t fully satisfy me, and I
        was seeking a new challenge that better aligned with my personality.
        After talking with a few friends about their experiences learning to
        code, Dev Academy caught my attention and so here I am!

        Persistence helps me stay focused and committed, even when the solution
        isn't immediately clear. For me it's about being patient, finding
        different approaches, and continually trying. I have a few close friends
        who have been working in web development for some time, and their
        passion has rubbed off on me I guess! I'm excited to be here and look
        forward to meeting you all in person.
