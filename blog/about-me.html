      <h2>Hey, thanks for stopping by.</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm Taine from West Auckland, I've explored various interests over the
        last 8ish years. I'm attracted to a challenge and love exploring new
        interests. I spent a few years in music, focusing on songwriting and
        production. I dabbled in the YouTube space eventually opening for one of
        my favorite musicians. Straight out of School I was desparate for coin!
        I went all in on a diploma in IT and Security Systems from Ames, then
        found a role in support for ESET Security. Needing to flex my creative
        bones, I decided I wanted to be an art director so I got my bachelor's
        degree in Communications majoring in Advertising. I spent three years
        whipping up social content for various clients such as Maccas,
        Woolworths, Sky, and Frucor brands.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Eventually I realised that advertising didn’t fully satisfy me, and I
        was seeking a new challenge that better aligned with my personality.
        After talking with a few friends about their experiences learning to
        code, Dev Academy caught my attention and so here I am!

        Persistence helps me stay focused and committed, even when the solution
        isn't immediately clear. For me it's about being patient, finding
        different approaches, and continually trying. I have a few close friends
        who have been working in web development for some time, and their
        passion has rubbed off on me I guess! I'm excited to be here and look
        forward to meeting you all in person.
