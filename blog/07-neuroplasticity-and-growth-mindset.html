          <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is essential for personal growth. Our brains are constantly presenting us with bits of information throughout the day. By actively training our minds, we can reorganise this information, form new neural connections, and strengthen existing ones. Mental challenges and obstacles, though difficult at the time, are ultimately beneficial and contribute to genuine growth in the long run.
          </p>  
          <p>
            You can increase your neuroplasticity by engaging with problems, and challenging yourself to find the solutions. Repetition is a great way to strengthen your neuro network. By repeating an activity, that in itself builds a stronger foundation. Once you’ve established a connection to an idea, try different methods.

            Dr. Rhonda Patrick says the word “brain fog” gets thrown around, but it feels genuinely much worse than it sounds. As a full time brain fogger, it was helpful to come across a video that suggests our eating habits are a huge contributor to our mental clarity. As a T1d this video is particularly useful to me, but even if you aren’t, it’s totally worth a watch…<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmX4ADLjuE"><strong>Watch here</strong></a>

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            A growth mindset is a pillar of success. The term coined by Carol Dweck, explains that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort and persistence. This is contrasted with a fixed mindset. Where people think their growth is stagnant. It’s important to note that you can still occupy a growth mindset, and still have ingredients of a fixed mindset. 
          <p>
            Here’s a link to a video I watched that outlines those ingredients @ 3:38, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75GFzikmRY0"><strong>Watch here</strong></a>

          <p>I
            ’d be lying if I said I was an “I can do it all person”. I’m still afraid of feeling embarrassed and not knowing something. However, applying some of the key strategies discussed in the video has already provided me with valuable insights that I’d like to introduce to my  dev workflow.
