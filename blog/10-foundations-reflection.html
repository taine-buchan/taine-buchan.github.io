          <h2>What I’ve Learnt About Myself</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I use my strengths to protect my ego. When I find something too
              hard, I avoid it by doing something that makes me feel
              comfortable, like picking up a guitar. In the moment it makes me
              feel competent, but it also means I stray from necessary growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              I tie my worth to how much I know. When someone tries to help me,
              I feel bad if I don’t understand what they're saying, as if I’m
              wasting their time. I struggle with accepting that learning is a
              process and that it’s okay not to know everything.
            </li>
            <li>
              I avoid discomfort at the cost of progress. I’ve realised I tend
              to steer away from things that make me feel incapable, even if
              they would help me improve. My ego prefers feeling competent over
              struggling through growth.

        <!-- Reflection 2: On Roles in Programming -->
        <section class="question">
          <h2>What I Think About Roles in Programming</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The reason I like coding is because I’m curious about computing
              and I value a challenge. It pushes me to dig deeper and learn new
              things. If I wasn’t naturally curious, I’d probably give up
              altogether when things get hard.
            </li>
            <li>
              I find my best music comes out when everyone in the band has input
              and actually adds something. The same goes for programming, it’s
              about having the empathy to let people bring their own thing to
              the table, and that usually makes the final product more
              interesting and connected, whether it’s a song or a coding
              project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having the self-awareness to understand how I look at my values in
              programming helps me understand that I have things I need to work
              on. It also makes it obvious that I am very self-critical and need
              to allow myself some breathing room.

        <!-- Reflection 3: On Learning Human Skills -->
        <section class="question">
          <h2>What I’ve Gained From Learning Human Skills</h2>
          <p>
            Human Skills has given me tools to self-reflect in a positive way.
            Now I have a better way to break them down and understand them
            without being too hard on myself.

          <h2>What I Found Challenging</h2>
          <p>
            Acknowledging that I don’t quite follow the rulebook of
            neuroplasticity and that it’s probably why I have trouble learning
            new things.

        <!-- Reflection 5: Why Human Skills Matter in a Bootcamp -->
        <section class="question">
          <h2>Why I Think Human Skills Matter in a Bootcamp</h2>
          <p>
            I think focusing on Human Skills makes sense because they’re a big
            part of programming in the real world. In web development, you’re
            not just coding on your own; you’re working with a team where
            different values and ideas come together every day. Being able to
            communicate, collaborate, and empathise with others is just as
            important as the technical stuff.

        <!-- Reflection 6: Time Well Spent or Wasted? -->
        <section class="question">
          <h2>Does The Time Spent on Human Skills Feel Like a Waste?</h2>
          <p>
            I think it depends on the type of person you are. If you already
            possess great human skills, perhaps a good chunk of it could be
            directed to technical learning. However, for myself it was a
            reminder that my human skills need improving. Investing time into a
            routine of healthy habits makes sense and I'll benefit from it in
            the long run.
