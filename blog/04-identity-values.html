          <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</h2>
          <p>
            I guess if I'm completely honest being in advertising for three
            years raised ethical concerns for me, working for businesses whose
            ethos goes against mine. It wasn't the sole reason I left but it
            played a part in my decision to explore a different career path.

          <h2>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Growing up in a lower/middle-class suburb of West Auckland, I
            developed a unique perspective that shaped my identity. When it was
            time to start high school, my dad enrolled me in a public school in
            central Auckland. the unfamiliar environment and long commute were
            daunting, and I had no friends. But over time, I found value in the
            differences that once made me feel out of place.
            <br />
            <br />
            My background became a source of strength, teaching me resilience
            and deepening my appreciation for my roots. These experiences shaped
            my identity, enabling me to connect with diverse people and embrace
            the richness of every community I join.

        <section class="question">
          <h2>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h2>
          <p>
            My persistence and creativity are my key strengths that will support
            me during my learning journey. My persistence ensures that I stay
            focused and motivated, even when faced with challenges or setbacks.
            My creativity allows me to think outside the box, find innovative
            solutions, and approach problems from different angles

        <section class="question">
          <h2>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development.
          </h2>
          <p>
            A limitation in my learning and career development is my tendency to
            overthink concepts, which can slow my progress. I also struggle with
            complex or abstract ideas, particularly those requiring deep logical
            understanding. While I'm passionate about design, I sometimes lack
            confidence in coding and technical skills, which makes me hesitant
            to tackle more challenging projects.

            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension.
          </h2>
          <p>
            My creative director at my old job liked to keep things
            family-friendly and safe, while I wanted to push the envelope with
            riskier ideas. It created some tension as I tried to come up with
            concepts that still fit the client's expectations. It was tough to
            balance creativity with getting approval, but over time, I figured
            out how to tweak my approach, communicate better, and still keep my
            ideas fresh.
