        <h2>HTML & CSS Concepts</h2>

        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). By the name only we can identify that
          the style of the elements inherit from styles defined beforehand. Like
          a book, code is stacked from left to right cascading down the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes in CSS are like organising your wardrobe. Imagine a sock
          drawer where all the socks are kept together because they belong to
          the "sock" category. Similarly, a class groups together elements on a
          webpage that share the same style. Just as you might have different
          sections in your drawer for different types of socks like ankle socks,
          crew socks, or dress socks, you can have different classes to style
          elements in various ways while still keeping them neatly organised
          under the broader category of "socks.
        </p>

          An ID is like a name tag for a specific item in your wardrobe. While
          classes are used to group similar items together, an ID is meant for
          one unique item. For example, you might have a special jacket that
          only you own, and you attach a name tag to it to easily identify
          it—this jacket is one-of-a-kind. Similarly, in HTML and CSS, an ID is
          used to identify a unique element on a page. It's like giving an
          individual item a specific label, so you can style it or reference it
          directly without affecting anything else on the page. Just as no two
          jackets in your wardrobe would share the same name tag, no two
          elements should have the same ID on a webpage.
