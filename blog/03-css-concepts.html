          <h2>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            My goal is to become a software developer. At this stage I feel
            naturally drawn to the front end stuff, but I'm not ruling anything
            out just yet. As we've seen time and time again, tech has moved us
            forward and done unimaginable things for people and the planet. I
            guess my ultimate goal is to leave a respective mark.

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h2>
          <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I’m curious and enjoy problem-solving.</li>
            <li>
              My background in creative advertising helps me think about user
              experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I tend to overthink things, which can slow me down.</li>
            <li>
              Some programming concepts are hard to understand right away, and I
              need more time to grasp them.
            </li>

          <h2>
            What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I want to improve my communication skills, especially in working
            with teams. I also want to get better at managing my time and
            solving problems more efficiently. Finally, I want to become more
            confident in giving and receiving feedback.

          <h2>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
          </h2>
          <h3>Productivity and Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            I’ll stay organised and communicate well with peers and facilitators
            to stay on track.
          </p>
          <h3>Handling Pressure</h3>
          <p>
            When things get stressful, I’ll break tasks into smaller pieces and
            take breaks to stay focused.
          </p>
          <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
          <p>
            If I get stuck, I will ask for help from facilitators or peers to
            stay on course.

          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          <p>
            I expect the facilitation team to be helpful and supportive. I hope
            they will guide me when I face challenges and give feedback to help
            me improve.

            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things
          </h2>
          <p>
            I have some freelance projects every now and then, especially in the
            evenings and weekends.
