        <!-- Reflection 1: Blocked on a Simple Problem -->
        <section class="question">
          <h2>Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
          <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
          <p>
            In the first challenge of javascript-kata, I didn't quite understand
            object manipulation.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
          <p>I decided that I would go back and look at resources online.</p>

          <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
          <p>
            It's really frustrating when you almost can read what's going on but
            you head over to write a code block and it becomes a mental block.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
          <p>
            If I don't understand something, look back, focus on the important
            bits, and simplify the question by picking out key words like
            "object, property, key, value". Then write out the changes clearly.
          </p>

        <!-- Reflection 2: Elegantly Solved a Problem -->
        <section class="question">
          <h2>Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
          <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
          <p>
            I'm unsure if it was elegant, but I was having an issue with
            flipflop where my condition was returning the first iterable.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
          <p>
            After what seemed like eternity, I decided it was best to reach out
            to someone and ask for help. Joeseph thankfully ran me through the
            material of the challenge and I was able to find the correct method.
          </p>

          <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Frustrated that my time was slowly eaten away and I had no answer.
          </p>

          <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
          <p>
            It's better to ask if I've been spending too much time on a problem.
          </p>
