          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is a measure of the ability to express and
            understand oneself effectively, and recognising those inner
            tendencies and how they affect others around you.

          <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
          <p>
            IQ generally focuses on logical thinking, problem solving. We often
            lump it into the "technical skill" category. It differs in that EQ
            doesn't focus on logic but rather feeling.
            <br />
            <br />
            IQ is the engine: It represents the raw power and technical
            capability of the car. Just as the engine determines how fast and
            efficiently a car can go, IQ measures cognitive abilities like
            logical reasoning, problem-solving, and analytical thinking.
            <br />

          <p>
            EQ is the steering wheel: It guides the direction and ensures smooth
            navigation. Just as a driver uses the steering wheel to maneuver
            through different terrains and handle unexpected obstacles.

        <section class="question">
          <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
          <p>
            EQ allows us to connect with ourselves and make effective decisions.
            It allows us to navigate the world when it is turbulent, and
            overcome barriers along the way. It helps us build relationships by
            allowing us to communicate with meaningful intent.

      <h2>What was it like to be fully listened to? (Dev Academy task)</h2>
          <p>
            It was an interesting experience. Knowing well that in those awkward
            pauses there was no ad libs to fill the emptiness. I overspent my
            time by 20 seconds, but I think that I went a little long because I
            didn't want to run short. What made me feel less awkward was meeting
            a like minded musician who had a similar background and who was more
            than happy to chat.

        <section class="question">
          <h2>What was it like to fully listen?</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy listening to people, but listening attentively is different.
            I used to feel the need to write everything down, fearing I'd
            forget. Eventually, I focused on remembering the key points rather
            than every word. After my partner shared the important parts, I
            found it easier to connect the dots and reengage with them.
